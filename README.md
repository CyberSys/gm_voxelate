## Documentation
See the wiki in the sidebar.

## Bugs
Please report bugs on this repository's issues page!

## Building
This is designed to be built with [MetaMan](https://github.com/danielga)'s [Garry's Mod](https://github.com/danielga/garrysmod_common) and [Source SDK](https://github.com/danielga/sourcesdk-minimal) headers.

It requires a compiler/runtime that supports C++11, which can cause problems on older linux systems.

**Windows**: Should just work.

**Linux**: Should just work?

**Mac**: Unknown, probably similar to Linux.

The test_install scripts are for quickly copying the binaries into directories on my systems, and are probably broken right now.

## Used In
[gm_f1atgrass](https://github.com/glua/gm_f1atgrass) - Testbed for the module
